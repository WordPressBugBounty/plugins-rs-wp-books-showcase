This book invites you―no matter what your practice may be―to access the treasure chest of Islamic spirituality, particularly Sufism, and use its wealth to strengthen your own journey.</span></p><p><span>The riches include guidance drawn from the Qur'an, sayings of the Prophet Muhammad and Sufi poets such as the thirteenth-century Rumi on cultivating awareness, intentionality and compassion for self and others. This book also features entertaining wisdom teaching stories, especially those of Mulla Nasruddin, Islam's great comic foil, to expand the mind and heart. It breaks down barriers to accessing this ancient tradition for modern seekers by dispelling myths about the Muslim faith concerning gender bias, inclusivity and appreciation for diversity.</span></p><p><span>Regardless of where you are on your spiritual journey, you will find these gems worthy additions to your own treasure chest within.</span></p>",

    "description": "<span>There are nine geo–cultural \"rooms\" in the \"House of Islam,\" and the Wind of God's Spirit is blowing through every one of them. David Garrison spent three years travelling a quarter–million miles through every corner of the Muslim world to investigate reports far and wide of Muslims turning to faith in Jesus Christ. In this amazing odyssey, Garrison gathered the stories of more than a thousand Muslim–background believers, asking them the question: \"What did God use to bring you to faith in Jesus Christ? Tell me your story.\"<br> The result is a historic and unprecedented insight into the greatest turning of Muslims to Christ in history. Hear the stories of men and women who have sacrificed everything – home, family, even their lives – for the sake of following Jesus. <br> In this book, you will hear from men and women from West Africa to Indonesia and everywhere in between. You will see how God is at work through answered prayers; dreams and visions; 21st–century technologies such as Internet, satellite television, video and audio tools; and bold Christian witnesses who have often paid the ultimate price for the sake of reaching Muslims for Jesus Christ. Along the way, you will also gain insights into the fascinating background of each of these nine geo–cultural rooms in the House of Islam.<br> Finally, and most importantly, you will learn how you too can be a part of the greatest turning of Muslims to Christ in history, both overseas and in your own community.<br></span>",

    "description": "<p><span>Following the path of time, we had all the Enlightened Entities coming into this world for our salvation. Without Their involvement, we humans, who are considered as the most superior among the living beings, may not sustain as we often prioritize our individual desires. However, this insatiable greed has had profound repercussions. Our very minds have become the catalyst for division, leading us down a path of violence in our relentless pursuit of personal gratification. We exhibit a willingness to resort to any means necessary to actualize our desires, which includes depriving people of their rights and enforcing dominance based on discriminatory notions of caste and creed. We have become disturbingly adept at taking human lives, executing such horrific acts with alarming efficiency and precision. Our proficiency in this regard is reminiscent of a well-practiced task, executed with a level of professionalism that leaves little room for error even to repent. Regrettably, our conduct surpasses that of mere animals, reflecting a deeply troubling inclination towards acts of violence. Our actions speak louder than our words. Being born as the greatest of the creation doesn't make us great at all. It is knowledge and philosophies that make us true human beings. That is the reason behind all These Entities coming to us and blessing us with knowledge, art, and philosophy.</span></p><p></p><p><span>We as the children of Almighty have this life to blossom ourselves. Throughout the teachings of various religious and philosophical doctrines, a resounding and persistent message resonates. And that is Love. God Himself is the ultimate form of Love and He has manifested His Divine or Absolute Love within His creation.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The central theme of this book revolves around the concept of Love as a unifying message in various religious and philosophical doctrines. It underscores that despite different paths, the ultimate truth remains the same. It aims to showcase the shared understanding across diverse religions and philosophies, promoting unity rather than division among them.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The book does not want to preach Islam nor does it try to establish it as a superior religion. It represents the true philosophy of Prophet Mohammad (A) i.e., Mohammadanism, and how it bears striking resemblance to analogous precepts found within numerous philosophical &amp; religious systems, thereby illustrating a shared understanding across diverse religions &amp; philosophies. Paths are many but the Truth is One. Whichever path we may follow, if we follow it correctly then it will ensure a trajectory leading to success and fulfillment in our lives.</span></p><p></p><p><span>The name of this book \"All the religions are Islam\" is not to uphold the dignity of a particular religion over other religions, but to demonstrate that every religion is the same in such a manner that it is just a matter of language whichever way we may want to call it. It may be Islam in Arabic, Sanatan in Sanskrit, Judaism &amp; Christianity in English Etc. Likewise, we can call ourselves Upāsaka or Upāsikā (attendant, a disciple of Buddha), Muslim in Arabic, Yĕhūdhī in Hebrew, Christianos in Greek, Etc. This book gives an illustration of the evolution of time &amp; how it gradually affects the philosophy of religion. Specifically, this book illustrates how Islam got rid of its roots due to the social &amp; political influencers (kings, emperors, rulers, leaders) who use religion as a tool for executing their interests and strengthening their attorney of power.</span></p><p></p><p><span>In summary, the book explores the significance of Enlightened Entities, the unifying message of Love across Religions, and the book's point of view of promoting unity among diverse philosophies. This book urges people to avoid extremism, sectarianism, and racism and advocates for a harmonious and inclusive approach to spirituality which is the fundamental core of religious doctrines.</span></p>",
